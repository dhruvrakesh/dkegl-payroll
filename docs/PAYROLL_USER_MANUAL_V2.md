## Attendance Data Entry & Duplicate Protection

### üîí CRITICAL: Understanding Duplicate Protection

The system employs **FOUR LAYERS** of duplicate protection:

#### 1. Database-Level Constraints
- **Primary Protection**: Unique constraint on `(employee_id, attendance_date)`
- **Secondary Protection**: Composite unique index preventing duplicate entries
- **Physical Prevention**: Database physically rejects duplicate records

#### 2. Application-Level Validation
- **Pre-Insert Checks**: Validates data before database insertion
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on duplicate attempts
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Specific error messages with resolution guidance

#### 3. UI/UX Separation
- **Upload vs Update**: Separate interfaces for different operations
- **Clear Process Flow**: Visual distinction between new entry and corrections
- **User Guidance**: Built-in help text and process explanations

#### 4. Audit Trail System
- **Complete Logging**: Every operation recorded with timestamp
- **User Tracking**: Who performed what action when
- **Change History**: Full audit trail of all modifications

### Individual Attendance Entry

1. Navigate to **Attendance** tab
2. Select **"Individual Entry"** view
3. Choose employee from dropdown
4. Select attendance date
5. Enter attendance details:
   - **Hours Worked**: Regular working hours (0-24)
   - **Overtime Hours**: Additional hours beyond regular time
   - **Status**: Present, Leave, Weekly Off, etc.
   - **Unit**: Override default unit if needed

6. Click **"Save Attendance"**

### Attendance Status Types

- **EARNED_LEAVE**: Earned leave taken
- **SICK_LEAVE**: Sick leave taken
- **UNPAID_LEAVE**: Leave without pay
- **WEEKLY_OFF**: Scheduled weekly off day
- **HOLIDAY**: Public holiday

### üö® CRITICAL: Bulk Upload vs Bulk Update

#### Bulk Upload (New Records Only)
**Use When**: Adding new attendance records that don't exist

1. Navigate to **Attendance** tab ‚Üí **Bulk Upload**
2. Click **"Download Template"**
3. Fill in the CSV template with NEW attendance data
4. Upload the completed file
5. Review validation results

2. **REQUIRED**: Enter update reason (for audit purposes)
3. Download update template
4. Fill in corrections/additions

Method: Upload same data again with OT hours
Result: ERROR - "Duplicate attendance record for employee EMP-001 on 2024-01-15"
Status: Upload rejected, original data unchanged (SAFE)
```

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT Method - Using Bulk Update
```
Scenario: You uploaded attendance without OT hours, now want to add OT
Method: Use Bulk Update with update reason
Process:
1. Navigate to Attendance ‚Üí Bulk Update
2. Enter reason: "Adding overtime hours to existing records"
3. Upload CSV with OT data
4. System updates existing records
5. Complete audit trail maintained
```

### CSV Template Format
